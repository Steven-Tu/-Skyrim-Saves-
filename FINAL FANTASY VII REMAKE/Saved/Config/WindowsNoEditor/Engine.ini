[SystemSettings]
# Edit this file with any CVar changes you want the game to use on startup (make sure they're underneath the [SystemSettings] line)
# and copy it into your "Documents\My Games\FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\" folder, as Engine.ini
# (you might need to create the WindowsNoEditor folder, since game doesn't create it by default)
# If CVars don't seem to be changed ingame (you can check with dev-console), try renaming Engine.ini to Engine instead
# as your system might be hiding the existing .ini extension (Windows hides extensions by default)

# The ingame resolution options are limited to 2160p and below
# but you can uncomment the r.SetRes line below & change it to any custom resolution supported by your GPU/monitor
# If the SetRes string ends with "f" (without quotes), the game will try using exclusive fullscreen (requires -dx11 launch param)
# Similarly, "wf" will run it in a borderless window, while "w" will use windowed mode
# Note that exclusive fullscreen seems to have issues when alt-tabbing!
#r.SetRes=2560x1440f

# Uncomment lines below to disable the buggy dynamic resolution used by the game
# (UE4 on PC isn't meant to use DRS, UE4 devs themselves have said it won't run on PC properly, see my post for more info: https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/10858168-ffviihook-ue4-dev-console-unlocker/page-44#entry103836498)
#r.DynamicRes.OperationMode=0
